# WeatherBot-AI
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 and the Visual Crossing Weather API to provide weather information based on user input. The app leverages function calling, a cutting-edge feature of OpenAI's GPT-4o, to interpret natural language queries and fetch relevant weather data.
